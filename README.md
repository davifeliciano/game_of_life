A basic implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. Make sure to install the
dependencies with
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Run the game with ```python main.py``` or ```python main.py --elite``` to use an elitist strategy. To learn about the game options, type
```python main.py --help```
The script
[plots.py](https://github.com/davifeliciano/game_of_life/blob/master/plots.py)
was used to obtain some plots comparing the evolution of the population with and
without an elitist strategy. For more info, run ```python plots.py --help```.
